## ✨ Tech stack [🔝](#-table-of-contents)
For this project, I used [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for default package management for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment from Node.js and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)the open-source JavaScript framework used to build single-page user interfaces and web applications. In this project, I've discover Vite. [Vite JS](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) is a no bundler dev environment for Vue.js. It speeds up the front-end development experience of an application. Vite delivers the code via native ES Module imports during development, allowing me to create Vue. js single-file components without having to bundle them. I also have discovered the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework that allow me to build any design directly in my HTML.
